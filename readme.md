#Marapets Memory Game
##Copyright 2015 Katherine Cater
##Description:
This is the first version of my final for Programming Fundamentals. Over the summer I plan to add 
to it and update it. It is a simple tile matching game. It currently let's you press start then enter
your nickname, then it will welcome you.  After that it lets you match together the cards.
When you hit the end button. It congratulates you on finishing the game.
